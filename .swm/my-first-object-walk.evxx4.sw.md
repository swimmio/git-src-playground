## What's an object walk?

The object walk is a key concept in Git - this is the process that underpins operations like object transfer and fsck. Beginning from a given commit, the list of objects is found by walking parent relationships between commits (commit X based on commit W) and containment relationships between objects (tree Y is contained within commit X, and blob Z is located within tree Y, giving our working tree for commit X something like `y/z.txt`).

A related concept is the revision walk, which is focused on commit objects and their parent relationships and does not delve into other object types. The revision walk is used for operations like `git log`.
