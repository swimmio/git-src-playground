## Contributing to git

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to Git! Please be advised that the Git community does not use github.com for their contributions.

Instead, we use a mailing list (git@vger.kernel.org) for code submissions, code reviews, and bug reports.

Nevertheless, you can use [GitGitGadget](https://gitgitgadget.github.io/) to conveniently send your Pull Requests commits to our mailing list.
